# CS 210 – Module 7 Portfolio Submission  
### Project Three Preparation and Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains my Module 7 portfolio work for CS 210: Programming Languages with Professor Barry Pollack. The focus of this module is to reflect on the development of the Corner Grocer program, analyze design decisions, and document the problem‑solving strategies used throughout the project.

## Project Summary
The Corner Grocer project required building a C++ application that reads a list of grocery items, counts item frequencies, and displays results through a menu‑driven interface. The program uses file processing, maps, loops, and modular functions to produce accurate frequency reports and a histogram.

This module highlights the planning and reasoning behind the program’s structure, including:
- How I approached the problem
- Why I selected specific data structures
- How I ensured the program met all requirements
- What I learned about C++ and software design

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- File input/output handling  
- Use of maps for frequency counting  
- Modular program design  
- Menu‑driven user interaction  
- Debugging and iterative refinement  
- Clean, maintainable C++ code  

## What I Did Well
I designed a clear, modular structure that separates logic into reusable functions. I also used maps effectively to store and retrieve item frequencies, which made the program efficient and easy to maintain.

## Areas for Improvement
I want to continue strengthening my ability to break down large problems into smaller components and improve my confidence with more advanced C++ features such as dynamic memory and exception handling.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
One challenge was ensuring the program handled unexpected input gracefully. I resolved this by adding validation checks and testing the program with multiple input scenarios. I also used debugging tools and print statements to trace logic errors.

## Transferable Skills
- Problem decomposition  
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Data structure selection  
- Clear documentation and commenting  
- Testing and debugging strategies  

## How This Project Can Be Enhanced
Future improvements could include:
- Adding error logging  
- Improving the user interface  
- Expanding the program to support additional data formats  
- Implementing unit tests for each function  

## Files Included
- **README.md** – Project documentation  
- **ProjectThreeSummary** – Written reflection for Module 7  
- Any additional supporting files required for the assignment
